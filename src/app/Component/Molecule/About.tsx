                <p className="py-4">
                    I've had a bit of a zigzag career pathâ€”from running the show as a <span className="text-white underline">front desk manager</span>, 
                    to sweating it out in kitchens as a <span className="text-white underline">cook</span>, 
                    and now diving headfirst into <span className="text-white underline">web development</span>. 
                    Turns out, I just love making stuff, whether it's a great user experience, a killer plate of pasta, or a weird little resin dungeons and dragon dice.
                </p>
                <p className="pb-4">
                    Coding scratches that same itch for me: mixing creativity with problem-solving, and (usually) ending up with something cool. 
                    When I'm not glued to my computer, I'll probably be trying to make a new dish or trying out a new restaurant. I also recently got into 3D modeling.

                <p className="pb-4">
                    I'm all about the messy, rewarding process of building things <span className="text-white underline decoration-dashed">soo let us build stuff together!</span>
